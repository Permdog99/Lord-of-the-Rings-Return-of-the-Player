## Description
You, the player, hear a voice calling your name. You can see nothing but a black void. As the voice gets louder and louder, you start to see a glimpse of the sun. You are now awake. You are on a hill, the grass is bright green, and there a people that are half the size as you. You are in the Shire, a place with Hobbits and beautiful vistas. What will you do next?

### What is this modpack?
Middle-earth: Refabricated is a modpack that is based around the [Middle-earth](https://modrinth.com/mod/middle-earth) mod, while adding QOL features and performance improvements.

<details>
<summary>üì• Installation Guide</summary>

There are multiple ways to install and experience Re-Console: Legacy.
## 3rd Party Launchers
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)

For the easiest possible installation, I recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install Middle-earth: Refabricated by searching for the modpack in the Modpacks section.

### Prism Launcher
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance, go to the Modrinth section, and search "Middle-earth: Refabricated".
